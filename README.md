# HacktoberFest - Getting Started ðŸŽƒ
This repository is meant to provide you with the support and platform for making your first steps into the world of Open Source and [HacktoberFest 2021](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/).
We have a ton of mini projects and quests (aka issues) which can help you getting your first pull requests into HacktoberFest and getting a feel of open source.

## What is HacktoberFest?
Hacktoberfest, in its 8th year, is a month-long celebration of open source software run by DigitalOcean. During the month of October, you are invited to join open-source software enthusiasts, beginners, and the developer community by contributing to open-source projects.

Unlike other HacktoberFest repositories, this repository also has an extra goal of helping students get the hang of identifying ways to solve problems in codes written by others. The sample codes in this repository are far from ideal and contain a lot of errors, bugs and bad code practices. Your job is to create pull requests containing fixes for these issues. Aside, from the ones listed in the issues panel, you may also create pull requests if you feel that anything in a code is inefficient and can be done in a better, more reasonable way.

## How to make a Pull Request?
Before anything, you should get acquianted with the basics of the using GitHub for open source.

 1. Create a fork of this repository by clicking "fork" on the top right of your screen. In simple terms, this will create a copy of the repository on your GitHub account.
 2. Clone your forked repo to your local computer:
 ```git clone https://github.com/your_username/hacktoberfest.git```
 Don't forget to replace your_username with your GitHub username.
 3. Create/move to a new branch. Any changes you make should be applied to this branch.
 ```git checkout -b branch_name```
 Replace branch_name with whatever name you want to give it.
 4. Make whatever updates, fixes and changes you need to make.
 5. Commit and push your changes to GitHub.
	 ```
	git add .
	git commit -m 'Commit Message'
	git push origin branch_name
	```
	Replace 'Commit Message' with a meaningful short description of whatever changes you made and branch_name with the name you gave earlier.
6. Open your forked repository on GitHub and click on the `New Pull Request` button.
7. Type in the details of your pull request (what changes you made, whether it was meant to solve some issue, etc) and submit it.
8. Wait for the pull request to be approved. We will provide necessary feedback as required.

Alternatively, you can perform some tasks directly from the web interface of GitHub.
You can refer to these extra resources for Git and Github:

 - [Introduction to GitHub | GitHub Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github)
 - [Hacktoberfest 2021 Resources](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/resources)
 - [Git Tutorial from W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/git/)

Continue once you think you have understood the above steps.

## I think I understand
Cool perfect!
Now let's start working on some real code. 
1. Go to the issues panel of our repository. There are a lot of practice issues which have been reported in various files and mini-projects of the repository.
2. In your forked repository, make the changes required to solve this issue and make  a new pull request. 
3. Don't forget to mention the issue ID like `Fixes #40` in your pull request description.	

## Go On
Don't stop here. This repository is just your first steps into Hacktober/Open Source. Explore more repositories on GitHub, contribute to various projects and improve your Git skills.
